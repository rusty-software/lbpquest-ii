Pool with grotto and hot tub overlooking pond beyond narrow guage fencing

Circular driveway, covered porch, six half-columns, dormer windows on second level, fake window in far upper left, chimney attached?
	In the middle of the circular drive are some shrubs surrounding a collection of stacked rocks
	Cross between golf cart and ATV is parked in front.
	
Red velvet pool table covers cowskin rug. Four portraits on the wall: three birds, one deer (stag). Gap in between. Small round table with two barstools in front of a semi-circular mirror.

Children's play area, including swing set with large slide attached to two raised wooden playhouses separated by a crawl bridge. Small slide down from one of the playhouses into the splashpad. Middle of the splashpad area has a pole with lampshade looking hood from which water pours. Also water shoots out of the ground. Surrounding is forest in back, grass and more large rocks in front, lavendar flowers next to the rocks.

To the side of the play area is an open air but covered revival area. Seriously, crosses on the back walls next to two doors, keyboards beneath the crosses, rocking chairs on the edge facing the play area.

Every other picture is a deer. Wonder if they have a say in running the place?

Bridge over the pond feeder leads to heavily wooded area.

Main living area is open-to-below. Hearth has three deer statuettes with a large taxidermied buck above. More taxidermy, smaller buck this time, on shelf to the right. More christian cross here as well. The left has an ancient, crappy TV. Fireplace is physically blocked by large, leafy potted plant.

The next picture is the same room from a different angle. This time, there are two more deer heads, one above each of the bookshelves to the left and right of the fireplace. There's also an upgraded TV, and the plant in front of the fireplace has been replaced with deer horns. There's a cowskin rug under the coffee table, and a giant christian cross on teh bottom of the table. The throw pillos on the couch appear to be pelt-styled, as does the throw blanket folded there.

Another picture of deer: two white deer bucks and a couple of does.

A strange picture of firewood stacked in a field in front of the treeline. The firewood is held in place by two bent branches, and the ends of the firewood are painted like targets.

Covered area that looks like it contains a walk-in freezer off of a driveway. Another four-wheeler is parked here, but not completely under the covered area.

Bedroom with bassinet, three wiry crosses on the wall.

Two bbq smokers on a trailer. Unclear as to their state of repair, but one on the left looks VERY rusty.

Large stone firepit with benches around it in front of a metal-sided building of some sort. Building might be a shed, but looks like a barn, except it has a fancy door.

Another bedroom, this one with bunk beds. Only one cross on the wall, looks like white clay or porcelain. Found the crappy old TV -- sitting on a coffee table here.

Another shot of the living area. The bar is partially visible. The living room is changed yet again -- no deer horns on the hearth, more fowl taxidermy on the shelves. Also looks like a turkey statuette on the coffee table, and what look like moose antlers or tiny dragon winds on side table between couches. Also of note is that you can catch a glimpse of the Lobby from here, stairs heading up on the left, and a rolltop desk along their siding.

OMG, another angle of the living area. Another mounted deer head, and add an antelope head as well. First view of the dining area, and there appears to be a stuffed bald eagle on a pedestal in the corner.

Another bedroom, the artwork here is nature scene prints framed strangely and hung in such a way as to drive OCD folks insane. Two beds here: one has an arched headboard, the other has... no headboard at all. Arched headboard bed has swamp camo bedspread and throw pillows. The other has plain brown checkered. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?!

Another shot of the billiards room. Another antelope here. At least I think it's an antelope. The cowskin rug has been pushed further under the pool table.

Another shot of the insane bedroom. There is one window, with thick blinds/shutters just off camera. I wonder if this is a converted safe room?

Another shot of the first bedroom. Noticed this one has the same arched headboard. Bassinet is now missing, and the bedding is completely different. Clearest view of a dorner window seat with a nice red butt pillow.

Another shot of the billiards room, from a higher angle. Part way up the stairs, maybe?

Another bedroom, bed hidden under sloping roof to the left, dormer seat further to the right. A side table sits at the foot of the bed. Looks like a fancy lamp, fake plant, and thin blue-covered book are atop it. Book reminds me of something wintery/santa. A sitting chair just off camera.

The largest bedroom so far is revealed. Antelope, bull, ducks, and deer are all mounted here, and an alligator rug is on the floor. Not-so-secret door to the right of the bed, with a small black floor fan sitting next to it.. Side tables sport mismatched lamps; lamp on the right looks like it's made of bone or branches. Mounted book shelves here -- looks like there's supposed to be a desk or table beneath, but it's missing now. Just off camera is a hide-covered chair or bench.

And now for a bedroom completely different. Wiry headboard, solid red accent wall, three famous architectural black-and-white prints (Eiffel Tower, Triumphal Arches, ???) over a mounted red candle, all centered above the headboard. Simple wide table with centered lamp. Dormer window seat is missing any padding?

Back to the large bedroom, this time from the side table. What I thought was a deer is a large antelope, but there's another deer head in the corner, mostly hidden by the book shelves. Atop the book shelves is a... bobcat? I think? And the chair/bench is, in fact, just a large wooden block with a deer skin draped over it. I suspect it's a small chest. To complete the asthetic, there's a tall vase with taller grasses sticking out of it, and a print of a baby in a diaper and backwards baseball cap talking to a... seal? I suspect it's supposed to be a puppy.

A better shot of the bar, which is actually the kitchen. Pretty typical stuff, except for the cow skull on top of the cabinetry. At least there's a built-in bread box.

Yet another shot of the three crosses bedroom. They really like this one. I just noticed that between the crosses is another black and white architectural style print, although I don't recognize the shot.

The last shot is from the corner of the living area, looking at the back... windows? Doors? Impossible to tell, since the thick blinds are all closed. If only someone with a sense of staging had taken more than one of these pictures...
