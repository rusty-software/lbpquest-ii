    "What you at first thought was an area from which supervisors could monitor children in the Splash Pad turns out to be altogether stranger. There is a solid roof overhead, but only support columns everywhere except the very back. You finally realize what this reminds you of: a pavilion, the type where old-time revivals might take place. There are some inoperable rocking chairs near the front edge of the pavilion, and an old keyboard bench next to what appears to be a makeshift pulpit. Crosses adorn the walls at the back of the pavilion. TODO: create items for pulpit and bench";
